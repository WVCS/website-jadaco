    <h4> Bio </h4>
  <h3>I am currently a Senior at Westview High School with a prospective graduation date of 2023. In school, I am involved in Link Crew as a leader for freshmen and play soccer at the varsity level. I have been a "link leader" since my junior year and have played soccer all four years.</h3>

<h3> Outside of school, I volunteer at an organization known as TVIA, or Teen Volunteers in Action. I serve as the current Treasurer and Class Representative, and served as the Peer Mentoring Lead for the 2021-2022 year. I have played club soccer since 2014 and have served as the captain on many of these teams.</h3>
